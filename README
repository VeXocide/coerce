This project had been renamed to "coerce" and can now be found in the Boost 
sandbox at http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/coerce/.

Note that the API has since changed:
 - boost::construe_cast<int>("23") is now written as  
   boost::coerce::as<int>("23"),

 - boost::construe_cast<int>("XXX", 42) is now written as 
   boost::coerce::as_default<int>("XXX", 42) -- the 42 is now optional and 
   when omitted it will return a default constructed int, this is especially 
   useful in combination with boost::optional,

 - boost::construe_cast<unsigned int, boost::construe::tag::hex>("0x23") is 
   now written as boost::coerce::as<unsigned int>("0x23",     
   boost::coerce::tag::hex()).

More examples can be found in the repository at 
http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/coerce/libs/coerce/example/.
