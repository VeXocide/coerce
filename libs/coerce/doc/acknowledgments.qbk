[section Acknowledgments]

First of all I would like to thank the authors of Spirit, Harmut Kaiser and Joel
de Guzman as well as everyone involved in the creation of this great library, 
without which this would not have been possible.

I am very grateful to Google for the Google Summer of Code allowing me time to
work on this project and Hartmut Kaiser for mentoring me.

A big thank you also goes out to Rudy Hardeman, for hosting a Hudson install
with MSVC 10 allowing me to test my code using this compiler.

Lastly a thank you to the whole Boost community, both on IRC and the
mailinglist for advice, comments and critique. In particular:

 * Michael Caisse
 * Joel Falcou
 * Thomas Heller
 * Hartmut Kaiser
 * Bryce Lelbach
 * Leon Mergen
 * Adam Merz
 * Carl Philipp Reh
 * Lars Viklund
